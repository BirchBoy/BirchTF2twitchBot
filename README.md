    This program is a twitch bot that interacts with tf2 using the RCON* protocol which allows tf2 to host a port for
    clients to connect to ei. this program.

    Things this program can do at the moment:
    1.Interact with a twitch chat and execute preset commands.
    2.Interact with the tf2 client using the console. In short use any console command that you could.
    3.Point system.

    *RCON stands from remote console.

    To-dos:
    1.Needs a tutorial from setup.
    2.Needs to add more comments.
