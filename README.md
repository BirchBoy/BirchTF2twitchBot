    This program is a twitch bot that interacts with tf2 using the RCON* protocol which allows tf2 to host a port for
    clients to connect to ei. this program.
    
    Things this program can do at the moment:
    Interact with the tf2 client using the console. In short use any console command that you could**.
    
    *RCON stands from remote console.
    **Except faster.
